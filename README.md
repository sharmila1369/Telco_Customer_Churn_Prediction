📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry. This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) using Machine Learning techniques.

The project covers the complete ML lifecycle, including:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Model training & evaluation

Deployment using a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions

🚀 Features
